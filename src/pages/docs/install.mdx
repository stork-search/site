# Installing Stork

There are two parts to Stork: the command line tool, and the Javascript module. Here, you'll learn how to install both.

<DocsNote>

If you're downloading a file from `files.stork-search.net`, make sure to read through [Changes to Build Artifacts on the Stork CDN](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/discussions/180), a Github discussion describing how files are organized on the Stork fileserver.

</DocsNote>

## The command line tool

<InstallTabs latestRelease={props.latestRelease} />

If these options don't work for you, please [file a Github issue](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/issues/new) describing the installation process you hope to see!

## The Javascript library

You can either load the Javascript library from the Stork CDN (backed by AWS Cloudfront) or by self-hosting it.

### From the Stork CDN:

Include the following script tag on your site, before your closing `</body>` tag:

<CodeBlock
  language="html"
  source={`<script src="https://files.stork-search.net/releases/${props.latestRelease.tagName}/stork.js"></script>`}
/>

When a new Stork version comes out, update the version that is pinned in the URL.

### Self-hosting:

Download `stork.js` and `stork.wasm` from the [latest Github release](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases) and publish those files on your web server. Be sure to serve `stork.wasm` with the [correct MIME type](/docs/self-hosting), and be sure to call `stork.initialize()` with the URL where you're hosting the `stork.wasm`.

Visit the [self-hosting guide](/docs/self-hosting) for more information.

## Updates and Semantic Versioning

Stork updates contain bug fixes, indexing enhancements, UI enhancements, and additional configuration options.

All files on the `files.stork-search.net` CDN are versioned. If you're loading the JS, CSS, or any command line binaries from the CDN, make sure to update the version number in the URL to stay up-to-date.

The project will maintain semantic versioning adherence in the following areas:

- Any working configuration file will still work with any later version of the Stork indexing binary, up to the next major version
- Any command line invocation will still give the same output for any later binaries, up to the next major version
- Any working calls to the Stork JS API (.register(), .initialize(), .search() and others) will still work with any later versions of stork.js, up to the next major version
- Any index file can be loaded with any later versions of stork.js/stork.wasm, up to the next major version

However, the project cannot guarantee semantic versioning adherence in the following areas (although if Stork is causing major issues with these, please reach out):

- The API of the Rust stork-search library published to crates.io
- HTML and CSS side effects of Stork themes (although the dynamically generated HTML structure will remain the same, to not break custom themes)
- Development processes

To track updates, follow the [Stork Releases RSS feed](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases.atom).
